# 🔧 30 Days 30 Project Challenge

Welcome to my 30-day electronics challenge!  
Each day, I build and share a new project using microcontrollers, sensors, and modules I have at home.  
Follow along and get inspired to build your own!

## 📅 Day 5 – DIY Arduino Oscilloscope

In this project, I built a simple oscilloscope using an Arduino to visualize analog signals like a potentiometer sweep or a 555 timer square wave.

### 🔧 Components Used:
- Arduino Nano
- OLED Display (SSD1306) 
- Jumper wires and breadboard

### 🧠 What It Does:
- Data is plotted live on OLED
- You can simulate different waveforms using 555 timer or real analog sources

## 📅 Day 06 – 555 Timer Variable Frequency Generator

This project demonstrates a square wave generator using the 555 timer in astable mode. A 100k potentiometer is used to adjust the frequency of the output signal. The LED blinks at a speed that depends on the resistance.

### 🔧 Components:
- 555 Timer IC  
- 100k Potentiometer  
- 10µF Capacitor  
- LED  
- 220Ω Resistor  
- Breadboard, Wires

### 🔍 Summary:
- Generates variable frequency square waves.
- LED indicates frequency through blinking.
- Great for learning timing circuits and signal generation.

### 📅 Day 7 – Tilt Direction Indicator (MPU6050 + STM32)

This project uses the MPU6050 sensor to detect tilt direction and lights up 5 different LEDs for:
- Front
- Back
- Left
- Right
- Center (flat surface)

### 📅 Day 8 – 1-Bit Full Adder (Logic Gate Circuit)

Built a functional 1-bit full adder circuit using 7486, 7408, and 7432 logic gate ICs. This is a basic yet powerful demonstration of combinational digital logic without any microcontroller.
