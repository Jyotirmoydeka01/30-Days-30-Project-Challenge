# 🔧 30 Days 30 Project Challenge

Welcome to my 30-day electronics challenge!  
Each day, I build and share a new project using microcontrollers, sensors, and modules I have at home.  
Follow along and get inspired to build your own!

## 📅 Day 5 – DIY Arduino Oscilloscope

In this project, I built a simple oscilloscope using an Arduino to visualize analog signals like a potentiometer sweep or a 555 timer square wave.

### 🔧 Components Used:
- Arduino Nano
- OLED Display (SSD1306) 
- Jumper wires and breadboard

### 🧠 What It Does:
- Data is plotted live on OLED
- You can simulate different waveforms using 555 timer or real analog sources

## 📅 Day 06 – 555 Timer Variable Frequency Generator

This project uses a 555 timer IC in astable mode to generate a square wave. A 100k potentiometer is used to vary the frequency dynamically.

### 🔧 Components:
- 555 Timer IC  
- 100k Potentiometer  
- 10µF Capacitor  
- LED + Resistor  
- Breadboard, Wires

### 🔍 Summary:
- The LED blinks faster or slower based on the potentiometer position.
- Frequency is calculated using the standard 555 astable formula.
- Great for understanding timing circuits and waveform generation.
